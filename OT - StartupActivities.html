It is easy to inhale and can get deep into your lungs. Eric Meier noted on <a href="https://www.wood-database.com" target="_new">The Wood Database</a>,    <p class="indented">Forget about the large chips and visible sawdust: perhaps the most damaging element is the invisible fine dust (sometimes called &quot;coarse inhalable particles&quot; ranging from 2-10 microns). Basically, these tiny bits of sawdust float around the air and linger even after the tools have stopped running.    <p class="indented">These invisible particles get inhaled and cause tiny wounds and scarring to our lungs: each time this happens, it causes a very small amount of irreversible damage. The immediate effect is unnoticeable, but over long periods of time, this can result in significantly decreased lung capacity, and a number of other health issues.<p>This is such a big enough issue that the United States Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has issued <a href="https://www.osha.gov/wood-dust" target="_new">guidance and standards</a> about it. They also noted,    <p class="indented">Wood dust becomes a potential health problem when wood particles from processes such as sanding and cutting become airborne. Breathing these particles may cause allergic respiratory symptoms, mucosal and non-allergic respiratory symptoms, and cancer.<div style="float: right; width: 300px; margin: 5px 5px 5px 5px; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid DarkGray; text-align: center; ";>    <a href="ShowPicture.html?ImgNm=Images/DrillPressSawdustCollection.jpg" target="_new"><img src="Images/DrillPressSawdustCollection.jpg" width="100%" /></a>    <b>Drill Press Sawdust Collection</b></div><p>Additionally, ornamental turning is usually done using woods which have a high probability of causing allergies and may even have some toxicity. Eric Meier has done a great job outlining this issue on his web site, <a href="https://www.wood-database.com/wood-articles/wood-allergies-and-toxicity/" target="_new">The Wood Database</a>. The list he has compiled contains quite a few woods commonly used. <hr class="style2"><p>I strongly recommend that you use a vacuum system with the intake as close to the cutting action as possible. The picture to the right shows dust collection on a drill press, but the same approach can be done on the rose engine lathe. Mine is held in a <a href="OT - LnT-Term-NogaArm.html">Noga arm</a> which I move around to where it is most effective (but not intrusive). <p>An overhead air filtration is also recommended; something like the PowerMatic PM1200. There are other good ones, and I recommend you get such a machine when you can.<!-- ################################################### --><!-- Step 1: Center the headstock --></tr></td><tr><td><a name="Step1"></a><hr class="style1"><font color=#191970><h2>Step 1: Center the Headstock</h2></font><div style="float: right; width: 500px; margin: 5px 5px 5px 5px; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid DarkGray; text-align: center; ";>    <table width="100%">        <tr valign="bottom">            <td width="33.3%">                <a href="ShowPicture.html?ImgNm=Images/Centering1a.png" target="_new"><img src="Images/Centering1a.png" height="150px" /></a>            </td>            <td width="33.3%">                <a href="ShowPicture.html?ImgNm=Images/Centering1b.png" target="_new"><img src="Images/Centering1b.png" height="150px" /></a>            </td>            <td width="33.3%">                <a href="ShowPicture.html?ImgNm=Images/Centering1c.png" target="_new"><img src="Images/Centering1c.png" height="150px" /></a>            </td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">            <td>                <font color="Green">                Headstock Rocking is Set Properly                </font>            </td>            <td>                <font color="Red">                Headstock Rocking is Skewed to the Near Side                </font>            </td>            <td>                <font color="Red">                Headstock Rocking is Skewed to the Far Side                </font>            </td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">            <td>            </td>            <td colspan=2>                <font color="Red">                Cuts may be wrong                </font>            </td>        </tr>    </table></div><p><u><b>Note</b>:</u> This step is only critical if you need to ensure the uniformity in a box's inside and outside surfaces.

Before making any cuts, ensure the alignment of the object whilst it turns slowly. A dial indicator is a great tool for this.<p>The bottom picture on the right is quite exaggerated but shows the idea of having the object misaligned.<p>If the rose engine's spindle has a Morse taper, and the chuck is held into place using a Morse taper adapter, then the object can be moved from one lathe to another and typically have very little misalignment. (This does assume you are not moving the object to a new chuck.) Another alternative is to use collet chucks.<div style="float: left; width: 250px; margin: 5px 5px 5px 5px; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid DarkGray; text-align: center; ";>    <table width="100%">        <tr valign="bottom">            <td>                <a href="ShowPicture.html?ImgNm=Images/DialIndicatorInUse.png" target="_new"><img src="Images/DialIndicatorInUse.png" width="100%" /></a>                <br>                <b>Dial Indicator in Use</b>            </td>        </tr>    </table></div><p>Frankly, I find this the most tedious task and when first starting I sometimes wondered about the value, but it is very important. If it is not done, then the cuts on one side of the object will be different than the other side. And it will get worse the further the cuts are made from the headstock.<p>When using the dial indicator (held in a <a href="OT - LnT-Term-NogaArm.html">Noga arm</a> or similar device), I aim for a runout as small as possible, but oftentimes it is difficult to get under 0.010&quot;. This may seem quite big, but it is hard to achieve if you do not have a <a href="OT - LnT-Term-Chuck-Leveling.html">leveling chuck</a>.<p>The picture to the left shows a dial indicator in use on a metal lathe. A similar approach would be used on the MDF rose engine lathe, though it is recommended that the measurements be made at the end furthest from the chuck / headstock.<!-- ################################################### --><!-- Step 3: Choose the cutting frame or drill spindle to use --></tr></td><tr><td><a name="Step3"></a><hr class="style1"><font color=#191970><h2>Step 3: Choose the Cutting Frame or Drill Spindle to Use</h2></font><h3>Cutting Frame</h3><div style="float: right; width: 350px; margin: 5px 5px 5px 5px; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid DarkGray; text-align: center; ";>    <a href="ShowPicture.html?ImgNm=Images/Cutters-Old.png" target="_new"><img src="Images/Cutters-Old.png" width="100%" /></a>    Traditional Fly Cutters</div><p>The cutter you use in a cutting frame drives what is achieved from the process. <p>The typical cutter is either a fly cutter cut to 60&deg; or uses a carbide insert (also at 60&deg;).<p>Other angles or shapes can be used, and the ones used for fly cutting are well documented in Holtzapffel's <u>Turning and Mechanical Manipulation, vol. 5 - The Principles and Practice of Ornamental or Complex Turning</u>.

On a rose engine lathe, this invariably leaves the smoothest surface.<p>Based on the cutter's rotational direction (the blue arrow), the cutting frame's movement (the red arrow) should be set accordingly to accommodate down-hill cutting.<p>This is traditionally an advantage for using a fly cutter over carbide inserts, as a fly cutter's direction of rotation can be reversed.<!-- ################################################### --><!-- Step 7: Set the Speed for the Cutting Tool --></tr></td><tr><td><a name="Step7"></a><hr class="style1"><font color=#191970><h2>Step 7: Set the Speed for the Cutting Tool</h2></font><p>When I was getting started with ornamental turning, I asked how fast the cutter should be spun. The gentleman responded, &quot;I run it as fast as I can without burning the wood.&quot;<p>It is common to use a variable speed motor like the midi lathe conversion kit from Penn State Industries for the overhead drive. To drive the belt, it is also common to use a multi-step pulley, with the pulley sizes at 4&quot;, 3&quot;, and 2&quot; diameter. Based on that, the 4&quot; pulley is used most often, and the 2&quot; one almost never.<p>General ideas are:    <ul>        <li>low density woods (like walnut) - run the cutter at maximum speed</li>        <li>high density woods like ironwood - run the cutter at medium speed</li>        <li>end grain on woods prone to burning (like maple) - run the cutter at slower speed</li>    </ul><p>Additional notes regarding materials used in ornamental turning are captured in the <a href="OT - Materials.html">materials section</a> of this site.<!-- ################################################### --><!-- Step 8: Adjust the Overhead to be Vertical --></tr></td><tr><td><a name="Step8"></a><hr class="style1"><font color=#191970><h2>Step 8: Adjust the Overhead to be Vertical</h2></font><div style="float: right; width: 300px; margin: 5px 5px 5px 5px; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid DarkGray; text-align: center; ";>    <a href="ShowPicture.html?ImgNm=Images/OverheadDriveAlignment.png" target="_new"><img src="Images/OverheadDriveAlignment.png" style="padding: 5px 5px; float: right;" width="100%" /></a>	<br>	<b>Overhead Drive Alignment on an MDF Rose Engine</b></div><p>The overhead drive should be adjusted so that the drive cable has as vertical alignment as possible.

The limit switch connects to the Control System for Multiple Stepper Motors, and once the cutting frame engages the limit switch, the cutting frame motor will be automatically stopped. This can help prevent the stepper motor from creating problems when trying to move too far.<p>One ornamental turner holds the limit switches he uses in a <a href="OT - LnT-Term-NogaArm.html">Noga arm</a>, enabling him to move it around wherever it is needed.  In the MDF Rose Engine Lathe 2.0 Library, there is a black book titled, &quot;3D Printed Parts&quot;.  That has some mounts which can be 3D printed to attach the recommended limit switches ( McMaster-Carr, part number 7779K13).<p>More information about the implementation of limit and home switches is on the limit switches config page in the &quot;Users Guide to the Control System for Multiple Stepper Motors&quot;.<!-- ################################################### --><!-- Step 10: Be Sure Everything is Locked Down Before Starting --></tr></td><tr><td><a name="Step10"></a><hr class="style1"><font color=#191970><h2>Step 10: Be Sure Everything is Locked Down Before Starting</h2></font><p>OK, this may seem unnecessary to state, but we speak from experience. We've all had a time when we thought we were ready to go, only to find out something wasn't right somewhere down the line.<p>The most common problem I've encountered is to not have the cutting frame well secured in the quick-change tool post, and the cutting frame inched its way up as the cutting goes along. But I've also had the problem where the MagSwitches were not engaged. This too became problematic at some point.<p>So, take the time to check to be sure everything is secured well before kicking off the cutting.<!-- ################################################### --><!-- Step 11: Make a Test Cut --></tr></td><tr><td><a name="Step11"></a><hr class="style1"><font color=#191970><h2>Step 11: Make a Test Cut</h2></font><p>Even when you think everything is perfect and ready to go, doing a test cut is something I like to do.
